## Overview

**SponsorSync** is a smart matchmaking platform that connects student clubs with the perfect sponsors for their events. Built for the EventEye Hackathon, SponsorSync solves the real-world problem of student organizers struggling to find the right sponsors, and sponsors failing to discover high-engagement student events.

- **Student clubs** create sponsor-ready event profiles (audience size, themes, past engagement, reach, etc.)
- **Sponsors** filter opportunities by industry, target demographic, and marketing goals
- **Smart matching** with match percentage, analytics, and AI-powered proposal generation
- **Modern, responsive UI/UX** for both mobile and desktop
